"This is hardly the first exchange we've had like this. Every other morning Rose comes up with something or another to definitely not be concerned about. I don't mind, though; that kindness is one of her better traits."

"The weather's been getting steadily colder for a while now. The few workers braving the morning chill are slowly making their way down to the bus station for work, those staying behind grumbling as they shovel snow from the roofs of their cars and their driveways."

"There aren't many students down this way as I walk, however. Student accommodation filled up fast, and the nearby apartments were all rented out soon after that. Thank goodness for a family friend offering to let me live with them."

"Helpful as Rose may be, there's still some sense of being a foreigner. It's only been two months since I moved in and started classes at college, my circle of high school friends and boisterous family home turning overnight to a cramped apartment shared between Rose and I."

"Walking through the halls at these hours is a wholly different experience to the normal hustle and bustle."

"Where students gossiped in the hallways, organized dates, and hurried between classes with arms full of overpriced textbooks, there's now a sweet silence. All to be seen at this hour is the odd straggler thinking more about dinner than schoolwork."

"Well, them and the Christmas decorations. I get the feeling that the arts and humanities staff take some enjoyment out of getting ready for the occasion. Much like the school itself, the decorations look a bit ragged, probably hauled out every year for decades."

"With little to do until Caprice shows up, exploring the arts building and peering into this classroom or that winds up passing the time."

"Heading up the stairs, I take my time strolling through the hallways. Everything is bathed in the orange of the sunset, the quiet of the halls giving the building a serene atmosphere. It's calming after the day's events."

"It isn't until a good few minutes pass that I find the first thing of much interest; a single room with the door left open."

"With curiosity getting the better of me, I stroll up the hallway and gingerly step inside. At least I can close the door for them."

"With only a handful of chairs actually set against tables, I'd think the room unused if not for the paints, papers, and sketchbooks strewn across the tops of the cupboards. If Caprice wanted a club room, this would be as good as any."

"As I peer about, the sight of one particular canvas amongst it all catches my attention. The painting of a woman standing in water sits drying on the easel, the painter's utensils still lying about."

"Stepping up to look at it, I'm surprised by how old-fashioned it is; like the kind of oil painting that would be drawn a century or so ago. Every brushstroke and line has depth to it, the painter's every movement clearly visible."

"I find myself struck by its beauty, time slipping by me as I stare. Her soft-looking skin and flowing locks of hair are enough to make me wistfully sigh, her face telling of her free spirit."
