"The two of us find ourselves in a surprisingly quaint little corner of America. A heavily forested town, with snow-covered pines visible no matter which direction you look. Wood seems to be the norm for building around here, rather than concrete."

"I find it quite charming, actually. I was worried I'd be awkwardly roaming through some manicured slice of suburbia, but this feels closer to a friendly country town. Almost something from one of Eileen's Westerns."

"With her father already preparing dinner as Eileen let me in, and her mother arriving from work only soon after, it was unavoidable. That being the case, here we all are, gathered around one big table."

"While not exactly a mansion, it's obvious Eileen's family lives very comfortably. I'd probably be green with envy at how well-off they are, if not for being so self-conscious of how to act in front of them."

eileen "I didn't think I needed to report back on everything I did."

elizabeth "Don't you think this is important enough to warrant a phone call?"

"Neither Eileen nor her mother raise their voice, even eating the odd bit of food as they quibble. The argument almost feels routine, which going by her father's reaction, might well be the case. Even her sister is still eating, albeit with badly-hidden glances."

"She looks pointedly to her husband with just an edge of snark to her voice, but he - perhaps smartly - simply acknowledges her with a smile. Dropping that on them here and now is quite the decision."

"I'm beginning to wonder why I thought this was a good idea. I can't read her parents at all, but I can already tell my presence here is only increasing a tension that usually permeates this household."

"It's ten-thirty in the evening, going by the clock in the corner of the broadcast. Adulthood's weird; now that I can go to sleep whenever I want without my parents disapproving, I dutifully do so at a reasonable time anyway so I can be fresh for school."

"Bored of the reports about trucks being stuck after sliding around on the roads, I let myself flop back onto the soft blankets as it drones on. Lacking the energy to do much else, I lazily stare upwards."
