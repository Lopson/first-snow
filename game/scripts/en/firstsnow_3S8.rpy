"The snowfall is thankfully light as I walk through the city, bags in hand from the day's last-minute shopping downtown."

"People calmly walk to and fro, the occasional passerby of Eileen's country home replaced by the crowds of downtown Utah."

"Briefly distracted by the huge Christmas tree - completed just in time for Christmas Eve - I think back to yesterday's events."

"When all's said and done, leaving Eileen's family ended up being a calm affair. I gave her parents my thanks for taking care of me at such short notice, and both said they'd be more than happy to have me again. Eve had also reluctantly come to terms with my leaving by then."

"Then there was the matter of Eileen. Our sullen farewell was short and sweet, but maybe that was because there wasn't much left to say."

"Thanks to my time in Colorado, a surprising amount of things I needed to buy before heading back to my family slipped my mind. At least wandering around the city tonight's given me a chance to unwind and set my thoughts straight."

"The screen shines brightly in the darkness of the night, the photo of everyone gathered in my apartment celebrating the end of semester making me mull over everything that's happened since I arrived here."

"It's only been a few months, but my time since starting college has been an adventure already. I've learned so much, found so many friends, and discovered so many kinds of relationships. It's such a different way of life I lead now."

"The smiling faces all gathered for that one moment in time... it's all thanks to those around me, like them."

"The phone goes dark once more as I lock it, the precious memory slipped into my pocket once more. The only light to be seen now is that cast by the Christmas tree, occasionally broken by the passing crowds."

"A strange sense of calm falls over me as I stand in the falling snow, hands slipping into my pockets for warmth."

"I was alone and afraid. Eileen was the answer to that, I thought. She seemed so cool and collected, managing life by herself. That strength of will was what drew me to her, in hindsight."

"It was thanks to Eileen, Caprice, and our little club that I was able to cope with being alone. The reason that I'm so at peace with myself isn't that I've finally learned to live without others. It's because I know I have others to help."

"Maybe I was too clingy, as Eileen  said. I just wanted to know her more, even if she was brusque at the best of times. If she wants to retain her solitude so dearly though, perhaps it's for the best that things go like this."
