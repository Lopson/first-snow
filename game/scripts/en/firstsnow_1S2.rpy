"The Saturday's morning air is brisk as I stagger back from the supermarket, hands full with bags. The apartment itself may be nothing to write home about, but it's certainly in a good location."

"I still don’t feel like I've been pulling my weight when it comes to daily life with Rose, but at least I can help with errands like groceries. Her attempts to teach me handiwork skills have been less successful."

"Even this much has been a learning experience, my parents usually doing the shopping back when I lived with them."

"She levers herself up with a grunt, before pulling back the edge of one bag with a finger to peer in, then another. I'm a little worried as she checks over my work."

"Having to hold my breath as she does isn't exactly helping. I'm still not used to the acrid smell of her smoking, but maybe that's a good thing."

"Opening the fridge, I get to work stuffing in the frozen and cold items first. Next, I open the cabinet doors and start ladling in the cans and boxes."

"As the empty shelves fill, I get an odd sense of satisfaction from caring for myself."
##Changed a later line from doors to cabinets. Left this one as cabinet doors, but not 100% on whether I should've left it or changed it to cabinets as well.

"Living as an adult is busy work, but it's rewarding in its own way. There's an odd and unexpected feeling of accomplishment from doing even simple tasks. I'm sure it'll wear off in time, but I'm holding onto it for now."

"I suppose there are downsides as well as upsides. Putting it out of mind as best I can, I head back down to Rose."

"So it's this again. This is another downside of living here. With so much of my time spent alone with Rose, there's - for better or worse - no easy way to escape her questioning."

"I know she has my best interests in mind, though. I'm glad to have someone around to help me get to grips with adult life, even if I did find her intimidating at first."

"I was never really interested in boys because I was so caught up in learning... is what I'd like to say, but I'm honest enough with myself to know that's not the whole story."
