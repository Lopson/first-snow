"Rose takes my pause in the middle of the city square as an excuse for a break, setting down her bags down as I look up to the huge tree before us."

"It's not the tree that's most interesting, so much as the crowd around us. Everyone walks to and fro just a little faster than normal walking speed, hurrying from shop to shop while hardly even glancing at the Christmas tree looming over everything."

"I think I read something once about feeling alone, even in a crowd. So many faces pass by, from couples holding hands, to businessmen, to groups of friends, yet I feel more disconnected than when I'm actually alone."
