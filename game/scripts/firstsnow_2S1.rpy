dad "Haven't caught you at a bad time, have I? I could call back later."

allison "What's that about?"

dad "Just a relief to hear that. We've all been worried about you finding new friends after such a big change. What with changing schools and moving out."

"Thinking to the people I've met in school, I guess I really have. Caprice pulled me into her orbit, Wallace seems nice and caring for all his intimidating size, and then there's Eileen. They might be a bit odd, but they're all caring in their own ways."

"It's funny how art seems to have drawn us all together, each in a different way. Before I respond, I vaguely hear my mother's voice in the background."

dad "Your mother said to ask if things are going okay at home."

allison "Everything's good. Rose has been a big help with everything."

"That's vastly understating things; if it weren't for her, I don't know how I would have coped. Not just for the constant housework and errands, but also for being away from everyone and everything I knew before."

"I hear my mother's voice again in the background."

dad "Ah, right. She knocked a mug off the counter the other day. Your mom gave her a good scolding. I think she's acting out without you around."

"I can't help but laugh imagining it, my mom exasperated with my cat."

dad "Anyway, we're getting by. It ain't the same without you, though."

"In a whispered voice, he continues."

dad "It's hard to get a moment's peace around here. Make sure to give your mother a call sometime, okay?"

allison "I'll call her, don't worry."

dad "'Atta girl. Anything worrying you? On your mind?"

allison "No, things are good."

"I realize my mistake the moment I answer, having spoken just a little too quickly to make it seem natural. My mind starts to replay embarrassing situations I've been in, the constant concerns and worries of living alone, the loneliness..."
