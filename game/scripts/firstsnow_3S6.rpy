"The park makes for a peaceful sight as we enter, the three of us slipping between the low wooden barriers as we step from the rough concrete carpark onto the snow-covered grass."

"A bundled-up Eve clings tightly to Eileen and I with both of her little hands, each of us on either side of her. A bag of old bread swings away at Eileen's other side, destined for the local wildlife. I'll feel like a killjoy to say bread isn't good for them."

"With the two of us acting as babysitters thanks to Eileen's parents working, we decided it'd be better to head outside than let her vegetate on the couch watching cartoons all day."

"It looks like nobody else is here at all. It is getting rather cold, but it's more likely people being busy with the holiday sales. I'd think the lake to be frozen over given how still it is, save for the birds floating about."

allison "She's cute."

eileen "Yeah."

"While Eileen smiles warmly at her sister, I struggle to do the same. I'll soon have to make the call for Rose to pick me up, after all, leaving behind this lovely town. Eileen, Eve, their parents; I'm not sure when I'll get to see them again."

"Eve clumsily crumbs the bread in her gloved hands, chucking it out into the lake with varying degrees of success. Half the crumbs end up dropping to the ground at her feet, but she doesn't seem to notice."

eileen "I really don't get how you're such an upbeat person in general, though."

"Nor do I get how she's so comfortable being so alone. So apart. The more I'm around her, the more different I feel we are."

allison "I just think it's better to see the best in people."

eileen "I have to admit, I wish I could be like that."

allison "Why not try being more friendly in general? Every time I see you, you're closing yourself off to focus on painting or trekking out in the wilderness."

eileen "The more I get tied up with people, the harder it is to do what I want to do. You should know that better than most, with Caprice and all."

"I'm a little taken aback at how firm my tone is, but I'm starting to get tired of how she's always so critical."

"I force myself to keep my eyes on Eileen, despite her own surprise. Maybe it's for the best if I clear the air and talk about this directly."
